Hello, and welcome to another _**CASL**_ release!!

This release has new features, a bug fix, and many breaking changes.

Breaking changes!! Yes, you read that right. We have made some breaking changes to the API in order
to make it more consistent and easier to use and to help solidify the public API before the release
of version `v1.0.0`.

:::info Breaking Changes Reminder
Remember, we are in preview!! So, breaking changes are expected and also encouraged.
Preview releases are an opportunity to fix any issues and improve the API before the final release.
It's better now than in a production release.  ðŸ˜€

We add all the breaking changes to the release notes for every release. So, if you are
upgrading, check the <ReleaseNotes projName="CASL" version="v1.0.0-preview.18"/>
for any breaking changes. You can also check out the project on <URL link="github.com/kinsondigital/casl" text="GitHub"/>
All issues and associated pull requests are labeled, documented, and organized into
milestones. It is effortless to find what you are looking for.

So, let's get to it!!

## Ok, let's hear it!!

The biggest feature of this release has been the long-awaited ability to stream audio playback
. Yep, finally. ðŸ˜´

This feature was a doozy to implement. A decent amount of changes, education, and debugging
had to go into this release so we could implement this.

But what is "audio streaming"? Also, what was it doing before this release? Well, in the world of
audio, there is data and a lot of it. There is a reason why audio and video files are so large
and also why compression formats are so standard in the world of media.

## What was it doing before?

Before this release, full buffering was the only type of buffering performed.
From that point on, the audio hardware was taking over, and the audio was in the audio hardware's memory.
CASL would send various <URL link="https://openal.org/" text="OpenAL"/> commands to tell the audio hardware what to do, and the audio hardware
would do it.

The problem was that _**ALL**_ of the audio data was loaded into memory. Though this works
perfectly fine, it comes with some downsides. The downside is the amount of time it would take
to load all of the audio data if your application had a lot of audio files and were significant in size.
Full buffering leads to bad loading performance and hogs all that precious memory you might need.

Think of a video game. You have a scene with many sound effects and various music tracks.
You try to load the scene, and it grinds to a halt because all the audio data is loaded before use.
Uh, it's not fun. Who has time for this?

## What is streaming?

So, what is audio streaming? Audio streaming is the ability to load audio data in chunks.
For example, you could have 1 second worth of audio data loaded. As the audio plays,
it detects when it reaches the end of that chunk of data. At that point, it loads the next chunk
of 1-second data, cleans up the previous chunk, and continues playing.

The benefit of this is that the playback of the audio only loads what is needed when it is required.
Without needing to load 3.5 MB of data, it may only load 1 kb. Stream buffering means
almost instant loading of any audio content.

But this also has some downsides. Nothing comes for free, you know. The downside to streaming 
is the performance of the playback operations. For example, let's say
I have an audio file that is 5 minutes long. When I tell the audio to jump from position 30 seconds
to 240 seconds, it has to perform some operations to figure out where in the data it needs to jump to,
as well as other technical things such as decoder operations and more.

Due to this, it is a bit slower to pause, play, or jump around in the audio data than it would be
if it were all loaded and ready to go.

## When should you use full vs stream buffering?

The usual rule of thumb is to use full buffering if the audio is very short and needs to play quickly.
In video games, these are usually sound effects. The player usually wants or needs to fire the weapon
in quick succession. Each weapon fire requires the sound effect to play immediately. It is ideal
to reduce playback lag as much as possible and use full buffering.

If you have an extended audio track, such as background music, it is ideal to use streaming.
This way, when a scene is loaded, you don't have to wait for 99% of the audio to load before it starts playing.
Also, playback operation performance is not required when performing playback operations on background music.

The above examples give you an idea of the use cases for each type. As with all
software, it depends on what you are doing.

:::tip  Remember
CASL is not just for games. You can use it to create any audio application!!

## Quick example

Playing sound with CASL is a breeze. All you need is a `.mp3` or `.ogg` file, and you're ready.
We've designed CASL to be user-friendly and intuitive so you can focus on creating great audio
applications without any hassle.

Full buffering:
```csharp
// Fully loaded audio data
var filePath = "C:/path/to/audio.mp3";

var audio = new Audio(filePath, BufferType.Full);
audio.Play();
```
Stream buffering:
```csharp
// Stream audio data
var filePath = "C:/path/to/audio.mp3";

var audio = new Audio(filePath, BufferType.Stream);
audio.Play();
```

That is it!! Super easy, right? Just choose what type of buffering you want, and everything
else is handled for you.

All of the other features are easy to use as well. To play around with a sample application
that shows off all of the features, and you can use the <URL link="github.com/KinsonDigital/CASL/tree/preview/Testing/CASLTesting" text="CASLTesting"/> project.

This project is just a CLI application used for manually testing _**CASL**_. But it is great
for trying out the different features from a non-code perspective.

That's it for this release!! Enjoy!!
