Hello and welcome to another _**Velaptor**_ release!!

This release brings you some small performance improvements,
the start of your mocking library migration, some API deprecations, and some bug fixes.

## <span className="color-section">Quick Overview</span>

This release of **Velaptor** brings you the following:

1. Small performance improvements related to fonts and rendering text.
2. Small performance improvement to OpenGL buffering.
3. The start of the mocking library migration process.
4. Removal of internal use of deprecated _**Velaptor UI Control API**_.
5. A small bug fix was discovered during development.
6. Internal dependency updates.


## <span className="color-section">Perf Improvements</span>

In the realm of game development, performance is a perpetual pursuit. We’re constantly on the
lookout for opportunities to boost the performance of Velaptor. This time, we’ve made a couple of minor enhancements.


While these modifications might seem small, they were straightforward to implement and have contributed
to the overall performance improvement. Specifically, we’ve optimized the way we interact with
OpenGL and transitioned the `FontStats` struct to a `readonly` struct, resulting in more efficient operations.

Please note that even the smallest performance improvements can accumulate over time, leading to
a significantly smoother and faster gaming experience. Stay tuned as we will as we continue to
enhance _**Velaptor’s**_ performance!

## <span className="color-section">Mocking Library Migration</span>

This is not going to affect any users of **Velaptor**, but this will affect contributors and maintainers.

### <span className="color-sub-section">Migration Details</span>

This is related to refactoring all of our unit test code from using the <GHProj owner="devlooped" projName="moq"/>
library to the [NSubstitute](https://nsubstitute.github.io/) library. This is going to take a while but all of
the issues related to this are created and ready to go. We will be working on releasing at least one of these issues or more per release.

### <span className="color-sub-section">Rationale Behind the Migration</span>


The decision to migrate from _**Moq**_ to _**NSubstitute**_ is influenced by several factors.
Like many .NET developers, I’ve used the _**Moq**_ library for mocking for a considerable period and
have found it to be a reliable tool.

However, as _**Velaptor**_ has grown in complexity, so too have
the verbosity and intricacy of the unit tests. While this is not inherently negative, it does
pose challenges in terms of maintenance and comprehension.

Over time, I began exploring _**NSubstitute**_ and found it to be a promising alternative as well
as not as verbose and more readable. A recent incident within the _**Moq**_ community was the
catalyst to finally deciding to make the switch.

For those interested in the specifics of this incident, you can [read about it here](https://medium.com/checkmarx-security/popular-nuget-package-moq-silently-exfiltrates-user-data-to-cloud-service-d1888867406d)
and [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A06nNjBKV7I).

While I have my personal views on this matter, I choose to keep them private. I firmly believe in the
inherent fallibility of people and do not think it was intentional.

However, it’s important to note that the decision to switch was not solely based on this incident.
There are multiple reasons, all aimed at improving the quality and maintainability of _**Velaptor**_. 


## <span className="color-section">Deprecated UI Usage Removal</span>

We deprecated the _**Velaptor UI Control API**_ in the last release which was version _**v1.0.0-preview.31**_.

In our last release, version v1.0.0-preview.31, we deprecated the _**Velaptor**_ UI Control API. This change doesn’t
imply the removal of the deprecated API from _**Velaptor**_ itself, but rather its usage within our internal codebase,
specifically in projects used for manual testing of _**Velaptor**_.

We have an internal project named _**VelaptorTesting**_ that is part of the codebase. This project, which is part
of the main codebase, was utilizing the deprecated UI API to provide a user interface for testing _**Velaptor**_.

:::note NOTE
Changes to this project do not affect
_**Velaptor**_ in any way.
:::

To replace the UI in the _**VelaptorTesting**_ project, we decided to use the <GHProj owner="ImGuiNET" projName="ImGui.NET"/>
library. This library is a popular and battle-tested solution that has been around for a long time, making it an obvious choice for our needs.
With the replacement of the UI API with ImGui.NET in the _**VelaptorTesting**_ project, we are now in a position to fully
remove the deprecated control UI API from the _**Velaptor**_ codebase when the time is right.


### <span className="color-sub-section">Reasons for deprecation</span>

The decision to deprecate the _**Velaptor**_ UI Control API was a significant one that I’ve been contemplating for some time.
This API, which enables the creation of UI controls like buttons and text boxes, proved to be quite labor-intensive during its development.
As I delved deeper into the API, I realized the enormity of the task at hand. Maintaining a UI library for a game framework,
where there is no consistent UI design across games, seemed daunting. The complexity and diversity of game UIs made the prospect
of a universal solution increasingly challenging.

Initially, I envisioned _**Velaptor**_ as a tool not just for games, but also for creating cross-platform UI apps. While this is
technically feasible, it requires a substantial amount of work. I didn’t want to compromise the quality of the rest of the
library, which is primarily geared towards game development.

Given these considerations, I decided it would be best to deprecate the UI Control API before we reach v1.0.0 and solidify the API.
This decision allows us to focus on enhancing the core functionalities of Velaptor.
However, this doesn’t rule out the possibility of revisiting this direction in the future.

### <span className="color-sub-section">Timeline for full removal?</span>

While the Velaptor UI Control API is currently deprecated, it remains functional. As you continue to use the API,
you’ll notice deprecation warnings in your preferred IDE or text editor.

If we were beyond v1.0.0 and the API had a substantial user base, we would delay its removal. However, given that
we’re still in the preview phase and the user base is relatively small, we plan to remove it in an upcoming release.
The exact release for this removal is yet to be determined.

The removal could happen as soon as two releases from now, or it might be delayed until ten releases later.
Given that the API is not primarily used for game UI but for UI apps, the likelihood of it being actively used is quite low.

:::danger Recommendation
We recommend updating your code as soon as possible.

## <span className="color-section">Bug Squashing!!</span>

Let’s be honest, there’s a certain satisfaction in squashing bugs, especially during development.
It’s like getting a bonus when you discover a bug while working on something else.
This is precisely what happened in our case.

<Image url="https://media.giphy.com/media/EmSCxtcjQCmXK/giphy.gif"/>

Then comes the realization that the bug has been lurking there for a while, making you wonder how it slipped
past you or why no one has reported it. But no matter how minor or improbable the bug, We are always ready to tackle it head-on!

This particular bug was quite unlikely to occur. It was related to an incorrect null reference exception that
would occur if you invoked the `Window.Show()` or `Window.ShowAsync()` method to start your game after you had disposed
of the game object using the `Window.Dispose()` method. One might wonder, why would anyone do that? Regardless,
the bug is now fixed. If you attempt to do this, you will receive a proper `ObjectDisposedException` message.


## <span className="color-section">Dependency Updates</span>

We keep our dependencies up to date as much as possible. This release is no different.

1. SimpleInjector updated from _**v5.4.3**_ to _**v5.4.4**_.
    - This is used for all of our dependency injection needs.
2. SixLabors.ImageSharp updated from _**v3.1.1**_ to _**v3.1.2**_.
    - This is used for loading image data from disk before being uploaded to the GPU.

## <span className="color-section">Wrap Up!!</span>
