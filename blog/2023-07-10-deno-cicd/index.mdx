## <span className="color-section">Intro</span>

A lot of us just want to work on our core project and not have to worry about things like
documentation, workflows, status checks, and a readme file, right?  I can empathize with that!! 
Though I'm passionate about making sure those things get done and done well, I also understand
that everybody's time is limited and you just want to work on your core project.

{/*truncate*/}

Here's the thing.  An investment in those things will pay off in the long run, especially 
when it comes to a good CICD pipeline.  You're swapping an upfront time investment for long-term
time savings. Running status checks for your pull requests, performing reliable releases 
and minimizing human error are just a few benefits of a good CICD pipeline.

I have used quite a few technologies in the CICD space: **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub Actions**, 
**Jenkins**, **PowerShell** scripts, **YAML** files, **NUKE** for **dotnet** projects, and more. 
However, one thing that I've used to help with CICD recently is **Deno** and I think it's
a game changer! 


## <span className="color-section">What is Deno?</span>

If you know what **NodeJS**  is, then the concept is the same.  **Deno** is a secure runtime for 
**JavaScript** and **TypeScript** built with <URL link="www.rust-lang.org/" text="Rust"/> and is the predecessor to **NodeJS**.  It's built by the 
same person who created **NodeJS**, <URL link="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl" 
text="Ryan Dayl"/>. As stated by Ryan Dayl himself, his experience and past **NodeJS** mistakes have helped drive the design 
of Deno.  I love it and I think you will too!!

## <span className="color-section">Some Deno benefits</span>

One thing that makes **Deno** awesome is the ability to execute scripts directly from the 
web using a URL.  That's right! You can execute a script directly from the web without 
downloading **NodeJS**  and using npm to install a package into the notoriously bloated
_**node_modules**_ folder. Just give **Deno** a URL and if the content returned is a 
valid script, it executes.

**Deno** also takes your imports into account.  Executing one file that imports another 
file will work as expected without the worry of dependencies.  **Deno** will download the 
dependencies and execute them as needed.

After using other technologies, then researching **Deno** I thought, "Why can't I just 
use this to help with my CICD pipeline?"  I can and I have!  

Here are some of the things you can use **Deno** scripts for:
- Perform validation on branches and versions
- Pull information like issues and pull requests about your GitHub projects 
- Improve and automate tasks when performing releases
- Improve pull request status checks
- Use the same scripts across multiple repositories for repeatability

Using these scripts hasn't only made my pipelines reusable and reliable but has also 
made them quick and easy to develop and maintain.


## <span className="color-section">So how do you do use Deno for CICD?</span>

There are different ways to go about it depending on your needs.  You can host the **Deno** 
scripts alongside your project or in a central location like another repository.  I have done both with no problems
and great success.

I currently centralize all of my <URL link="github.com/KinsonDigital" text="GitHub Organization's"/> CICD needs like
**Deno** scripts and reusable workflows in a single repository named _Infrastructure_. Having a centralized repo is also 
nice because I can version my scripts so I can methodically roll out changes to the consuming projects when I need to.

:::info Reference
If you want to check out some of my scripts or **GitHub** workflows that are used across my entire 
**GitHub** organization, you can check them out <URL link="github.com/KinsonDigital/Infrastructure" text="here"/>.
:::

Now that I've sold you on **Deno** ðŸ˜‰, let's create a status check workflow that executes a **Deno** 
script and validates that your pull request head branch is valid.

## <span className="color-section">Project setup</span>

### <span className="color-sub-section">1. Create or choose repo</span>
Create a new or choose an already existing **GitHub** repository.

### <span className="color-sub-section">2. Create new folder & script file</span>
In the root of your repository (or location of your choice), create a folder called _**cicd**_, then
inside that folder, create a file called _**validate-feature-branch.ts**_.

:::note Script location
It does not matter where you put your scripts.  That is up to you and your needs.
:::

## <span className="color-section">Add arg validation</span>
Add the following code to check that a single argument is being passed into the script from the workflow.

``` ts
if (Deno.args.length != 1) {
    console.log("::error:: The script requires exactly one argument that is the name of a GIT branch.");
    Deno.exit(1);
}
```

The **Deno** eco-system has a runtime API for various tasks just like **NodeJS**  does.  
One of those tasks is being able to get the arguments that you pass into any **Deno** script
using `Deno.args` array.

In the code, we added a check to verify whether or not a **single** argument was passed in.  
If zero or more than one argument has been passed in, the script will exit with an error code of 1.  
Using the `Deno.exit()` function with any number argument greater than zero will fail the **GitHub** workflow.


## <span className="color-section">Branch name and regex</span>
We can use some handy regex to validate whether or not the name of the branch meets our branch
naming requirements. Add the following lines of code to get the argument value and some regex to use for validation.  

:::info BRANCH NAME EXAMPLE
Example branch name for the following regex: `feature/123-my-branch`.  
A great resource for learning regex is <URL link="regex101.com" text="Regex101"/>!!
:::

Add the following constants to the script which will be used for the validation and the name of the branch itself.

``` ts
const branchNameRegEx = /^feature\/[1-9]+-(?!-)[a-z-]+$/gm;
const branchName = Deno.args[0].trim();
```


## <span className="color-section">Checking the branch name</span>

Now that we have our branch name and some regex to use for validation, add the following _`if..else`_  block. 
The workflow will pass or fail based on whether or not the branch name meets the validation requirements dictated by
the regex.

``` ts
// If the branch name is valid
if (branchNameRegEx.test(branchName)) {
    console.log(`::notice::The branch '${branchName}' is valid!! ðŸŽ‰.`);
} else {
    let errorMsg = `::error::The branch '${branchName}' is invalid.ðŸ˜¤`;
    errorMsg += `\nIt should follow the regex pattern: ${branchNameRegEx}`;
    console.log(errorMsg);
    Deno.exit(1);
}
```

:::tip Workflow Commands
The pieces of text `::error::` and `::notice::` are called workflow commands.  These will be used by the **GitHub** system
to display the text in a particular visual format in the **GitHub** console.

## <span className="color-section">Creating a workflow</span>

:::note GitHub workflows
If you are unfamiliar with **GitHub** workflows, check out the <URL link="docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions" text="GitHub Workflow Docs"/>.
:::

Now that we have our script, we can create a workflow that will execute the script.  Follow the steps below:

### <span className="color-sub-section">1. Create workflow folders</span>

If these folders don't already exist, create a folder with the name _**.github**_ in the root of the repository 
and then create a folder named _**workflows**_ inside the _**.github**_ folder.

### <span className="color-sub-section">2. Create workflow file</span>

In the _**.github/workflows**_ folder, create a file with the name _**branch-status-check.yml**_.

### <span className="color-sub-section">3. Basic workflow structure</span>

We'll give our workflow some basic structure like the workflow name, a pull request trigger, and a job with a step.
The first step will be the checkout action which is required to get access to the script file
in the repository.  

```yml
name: âœ…Branch Status Check

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches: master

jobs:
  branch_status_check:
    name: Branch Status Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

:::tip WORKFLOW TIP
I like to use emojis with some of my workflow names.  I find it makes it easier to visualize and manage in the **GitHub** web interface.  
I use 'âœ…' for status checks and 'ðŸš€' for releases.  You can of course can do whatever you want!!
:::


### <span className="color-sub-section">4. Setup Deno</span>

The **Deno** team has an action in the marketplace for making it easy to install **Deno** in the **GitHub** runner which is required
before you execute any **Deno** commands.  The good thing about **Deno** is that it's super small, cross-platform, and
has no dependencies.

Add the following step to the workflow below the checkout step to set up Deno.

```yml
- name: Setup Deno
  uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1
  with:
    deno-version: v1.x.x
```

### <span className="color-sub-section">5. Add script execution step</span>

Now that we have **Deno** set up, we can execute our script.  Add the following step to the workflow below the **Deno** setup step.

```yml
- name: Disable Testing Env
  run: deno run "${{ github.workspace }}/cicd/branch-status-check.yml.ts" "${{ github.head_ref }}";
```

:::tip WORKFLOW TIP
The `${{ github.head_ref }}` is a **GitHub** workflow expression that will get the name of the branch
that is being merged into the master branch. In this case, it would be the feature branch that you
want to validate.

Go to the <URL link="docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions" text="workflow expressions"/> **GitHub**
documentation for more info.
:::

The `deno run` command executes the **TypeScript** file we created earlier. Any `string` values separated by a space
after the script file path is treated as arguments.

The run command syntax is as follows:  
`deno run [options] [script file path | script url] [arg1, arg2, ...argN]`

Deno has a very nice security model that requires you to explicitly allow access to certain kinds of operations
like the network, environment variables, file system, and more.  In this case, we don't need to provide and allow
permission switches/options because we aren't doing anything that requires permission.

If you try to execute a script without explicitly allowing access to certain operations, you will get an error
with a descriptive message explaining exactly what permission is needed and why.

:::info DENO PERMISSIONS
Go to the <URL link="docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/permissions" text="Deno Permissions"/> documentation for more info.
:::

That's it!!  Very simple and the only limit is your imagination!!

## <span className="color-section">Summary</span>

Deno is a great option for creating utility scripts for whatever your needs are.  It can be
local scripts on your machine to help automate your development workflow, scripts to
do simple tasks in a project such as cleanup, or this case, for **GitHub** workflows to help automate
your CICD process.  I have personally been using this all over my organization and it's been a wonderful experience!!
