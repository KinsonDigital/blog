## <span class="color-section">Intro</span>

A lot of people just want to work on their core project and not have to worry about such things as
documentation, workflows, status checks, a readme file, etc.  I can empathize with this!!  Though I
am passionate about making sure these things get done and done as best as possible, I also understand
that everybody's time is limited and you just want to get things done.

<!--truncate-->

But here is the thing.  An investment in these things will pay off in the long run.  Especially when
it comes to a good CICD pipeline.  You just swap upfront time investment for long-term time savings.
Running status checks for your pull requests, performing reliable releases and many more
things are all benefits of a good CICD pipeline.

I have done quite a bit in this space.  **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, **PowerShell**
scripts, **YAML** files, **NUKE** for **dotnet** projects, and more.  After the time spent dealing with CICD,
I still don't regret the time I invested in my CICD skills.  But one thing that I have done differently recently
is use **Deno** to help with CICD.


## <span class="color-section">What is Deno?</span>

If you know what **NodeJS**  is, then the concept is the same.  **Deno** is a runtime for **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** is
the predecessor to **NodeJS**.  It is built by the same person who created  
**NodeJS**, <URL link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl" text="Ryan Dayl"/>.

It is a secure runtime that has a lot of
the same features as **NodeJS**  but with a few differences.  Past mistakes made with **NodeJS** as well as
lots of experience have helped drive the design of Deno.  I love it and I think you will too!!

## <span class="color-section">Some deno benefits</span>

One thing that makes **Deno** awesome is the ability to execute scripts directly from the web using a URL.  That is right.
You can execute a script directly from the web without the need to download **NodeJS**  and use npm to install a package
into the notoriously bloated _**node_modules**_ folder.

Just give it a URL and if the content returned is a valid script, it executes it.

This also takes your imports into account.  Executing one file that imports another file will work as expected without
the worry of dependencies.  **Deno** will download the dependencies and execute them as needed.

So I thought to myself, why can't I just use this to help with my CICD pipeline?  I can and I have.  I have created
various scripts for common validation, HTTP clients to help pull information from  <URL link="www.nuget.org" text="NuGet"/>,
my <URL link="github.com/KinsonDigital" text="GitHub Organization"/> projects, and much more.

Using these scripts has not only made my pipelines reusable and reliable but has also made them quick and easy to develop and maintain.


## <span class="color-section">So how do you do this?</span>

There are different ways to go about it and this depends on your needs.  You can host the **Deno** scripts right alongside
your project or you can host them in a central location.  I have done both with no problems and with great success.

I currently centralize all of my CICD needs such as **Deno** scripts and reusable workflows in a single repository
named Infrastructure.  This gives me the central location I need so all of my organization projects can utilize the
same CICD scripts.

This is also nice because I can version my scripts so that way when I make improvements or fix
issues, I can methodically roll out those changes to the consuming projects when I need to.

that are used across my entire **GitHub** organization, you can check it out <URL link="github.com/KinsonDigital/Infrastructure" text="here"/>.
:::

Enough selling, let's show you how this can be done by creating a status check workflow that executes a **Deno** script
that validates that your pull request head branch is valid.

## <span class="color-section">Project setup</span>

### <span class="color-sub-section">1. Create or choose repo</span>
Create a new or choose an already existing **GitHub** repository.

### <span class="color-sub-section">2. Create new folder & script file</span>
In the root of your repository, create a folder called _**cicd**_, and then in the folder,
create a file called _**validate-feature-branch.ts**_.  You can put these scripts anywhere you want.  
This is just for the sake of example.


## <span class="color-section">Add arg validation</span>
Add the following code to the file to check that the arguments will be passed into the script from the workflow.

``` ts
if (Deno.args.length != 1) {
    console.log("::error:: The script requires exactly one argument that is the name of a GIT branch.");
    Deno.exit(1);
}
```

The **Deno** eco-system has its very own runtime API for various tasks just like **NodeJS**  does.  One of those things
is being able to get the arguments that you can pass to any **Deno** script.  This is done with `Deno.args`.

In the code, we just added a check to verify if no arguments were passed in or if more than one argument was passed in.  If either of these
conditions is true, then the script will exit with an error code of 1.  This will cause the **GitHub** workflow to
fail and the pull request will not be able to be merged.


## <span class="color-section">Branch name and regex</span>
To check the name of the branch, we can use some handy regex to validate that the name of the branch meets our branch
naming requirements. Add the following lines of code to get the argument value and some regex to use for validation.  

:::info sample branch name
Here is an example of what a branch might look like for the following regex used: `feature/123-my-branch`.  
A great resource for learning regex is <URL link="regex101.com" text="Regex101"/>!!
:::

Add the following constants to the script which will be used for the validation and the name of the branch itself.

``` ts
const branchNameRegEx = /^feature\/[1-9]+-(?!-)[a-z-]+$/gm;
const branchName = Deno.args[0].trim();
```


## <span class="color-section">Checking the branch name</span>

Now that we have our branch name and some regex to use for validation, add the following _`if..else`_  block 
which will fail or pass the workflow based on if the branch name meets the validation requirements dictated by
the regex.

``` ts
// If the branch name is valid
if (branchNameRegEx.test(branchName)) {
    console.log(`::notice::The branch '${branchName}' is valid!! ðŸŽ‰.`);
} else {
    let errorMsg = `::error::The branch '${branchName}' is invalid.ðŸ˜¤`;
    errorMsg += `\nIt should follow the regex pattern: ${branchNameRegEx}`;
    console.log(errorMsg);
    Deno.exit(1);
}
```

:::tip Workflow Commands
The pieces of text `::error::` and `::notice::` are called workflow commands.  These will be used by the **GitHub** system
to display the text in a particular format in the **GitHub** console.

## <span class="color-section">Creating a workflow</span>

:::note GitHub workflows
If you are unfamiliar with **GitHub** workflows, check out the
<URL link="docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions" text="GitHub Workflow Docs"/>.
:::

Now that we have our script, we can create a workflow that will execute the script.  Follow the steps below.

### <span class="color-sub-section">1. Create workflow folders</span>

If they do not exist already, create a folder with the name _**.github**_ in the root of the repository and then in _**.github**_
folder, create a folder with the name _**workflows**_.

### <span class="color-sub-section">2. Create workflow file</span>

In the _**.github/workflows**_ folder, create a file with the name _**feature-branch-status-check.yml**_.

### <span class="color-sub-section">3. Basic workflow structure</span>

In our workflow, give it some basic structure such as the workflow name, a pull request trigger, and a job with a step.
The first step will be the checkout action.  This is required because we need to get access to the script file
which lives in the repository.  So we need to check out our code so that we can access the script file.

```yml
name: âœ…Branch Status Check

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches: master

jobs:
  branch_status_check:
    name: Branch Status Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

:::tip WORKFLOW TIP
I like to use emojis for some of my workflow names.  This makes it easier to visualize and manage in the **GitHub** web interface.  
I like to use 'âœ…' for status checks and 'ðŸš€' for releases.  You can of course can do whatever you like!!
:::


### <span class="color-sub-section">4. Setup deno</span>

The **Deno** team has an action on the marketplace for making it easy to install **Deno** in the **GitHub** runner.  This is required
before you execute any **Deno** commands.  The good thing about **Deno** is that it is super small, cross-platform, and
has no dependencies.

Add the following step to the workflow below the checkout step to set up Deno.

```yml
- name: Setup Deno
  uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1
  with:
    deno-version: v1.x.x
```

### <span class="color-sub-section">5. Add script execution step</span>

Now that we have **Deno** set up, we can execute our script.  Add the following step to the workflow below the **Deno** setup step.

```yml
- name: Disable Testing Env
  run: deno run "${{ github.workspace }}/cicd/feature-branch-status-check.yml.ts" "${{ github.head_ref }}";
```

:::tip WORKFLOW TIP
The `${{ github.head_ref }}` is a **GitHub** workflow expression that will get the name of the branch
that is being merged into the master branch. In this case, it would be the feature branch that you are
wanting to validate.

Go to the <URL link="docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions" text="workflow expressions"/> **GitHub**
documentation for more info.
:::

The `deno run` command executes the **TypeScript** file we created earlier. Any `string` values separated by a space
after the script file path is treated as arguments.

The run command syntax is as follows:  
`deno run [options] [script file path | script url] [arg1, arg2, ...argN]`

Deno has a very nice security model that requires you to explicitly allow access to certain kinds of operations
like the network, environment variables, file system, and more.  In this case, we do not need to provide and allow
permission switches/options because we are not doing anything that requires permission.

If you try to execute a script without explicitly allowing access to certain operations, you will get an error
with a descriptive message explaining exactly what permission is needed.

:::info DENO PERMISSIONS
Go to the <URL link="deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions" text="Deno Permissions"/> documentation for more info.
:::

Thats it!!  Very simple and the only limit is your imagination!!

## <span class="color-section">Summary</span>

Deno is a great option for creating utility scripts for whatever your needs on.  It can be
local scripts to do things for you locally on your machine to help automate your development workflow, scripts to
do simple tasks in a project such as cleanup, or this case, be used for **GitHub** workflows to help automate
your CI/CD process.  I have personally been using this all over my organization and it has been a wonderful experience!!
